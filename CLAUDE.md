## Git Workflow

- Commit and push after every few meaningful changes (e.g., after completing a feature, fixing a bug, or finishing a logical unit of work)
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" lines to commit messages
- Use concise, descriptive commit messages
- Push to the current branch after committing
